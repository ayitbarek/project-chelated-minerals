This project investigates how chelated mineral supplementation influences the gut microbiome of sows during gestation and lactation.

## Description

We evaluated fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analyzed community structure, diversity, and differential taxa based on mineral form (chelated vs. inorganic). we also analyzed the performance of piglets.
